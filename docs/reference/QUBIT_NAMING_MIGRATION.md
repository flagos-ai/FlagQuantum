# Qubit keyword migration

Implementation candidate on `qubit-naming-migration`; pending API/release review.

New code uses `fq.Circuit(n_qubits=2)`, `fq.probabilities(qubits=(0,))`,
`fq.samples(qubits=(0,))`, `fq.counts(qubits=(0,))` and
`fq.RuntimePolicy(observable_qubits=(0,))`.

Old count aliases and `wires` / `observable_wires` keywords emit
DeprecationWarning. Supplying both selection keywords is an error, including
explicit None. Positional selection and the Observable overload are unchanged.
The proposed schedule is deprecation in 0.3.x and removal in 0.4.0, subject to
release-owner review; this PR does not bump the package version.

RuntimePolicy writes schema `flagquantum.runtime_policy`, version `2.0`, with
`observable_qubits`. Its reader accepts the prior unversioned payload with
`observable_wires`, including module state dictionaries. Conflicting selection
fields and unsupported versions are rejected. Older package versions do not
understand the new writer; checkpoint compatibility is backward-reading, not
forward-reading.

IR and backend-native fields are unchanged. The deprecated observable_wires
property remains available on RuntimePolicy for callers migrating gradually.
API snapshots are deliberately not regenerated before contract review.
