# Private native Qmod source adaptation

Ecosystem owns lexical parsing, native syntax, symbol resolution and translation
into the existing Compiler construction profile. This is private development
evidence for one pinned source snapshot, not a public adapter/registry entry or
Classiq SDK/cloud integration. The public Python entry remains
`from flagquantum import synth`; its complete workflow is documented in
[the synth README](../../synth/README.md).

## Ownership and shortest contributor path

`syntax.py` has bounded lexing and a small precedence parser. Its immutable
syntax records never leave the adapter. `adapter.py` converts to existing
HybridProgram/Value/Operation/SourceLocation records and delegates semantic
validation to Compiler. QmodImport is a private handoff containing the program,
expression definitions, declared source-version context and inferred widths;
the existing InteropImportResult expects already lowered CoreIR and cannot carry
these construction definitions. This adds no public schema or generic IR.

The adapter does not synthesize, plan, execute, read files, evaluate source text,
generate Python callables or import optional SDKs. Compiler owns arithmetic,
initialization/lifetime checks, resource selection and target compilation;
Runtime owns execution. Never add kernels, per-file emitters or a second
semantic validator here.

```bash
python tests/fixtures/classiq_qmod/verify_sources.py
python -m pytest tests/team/ecosystem/test_qmod_parser.py tests/integration/test_qmod_parser_execution.py -q
```

The first command verifies seven source/license digests. The tests retain the
three original declarations, lower through Compiler and execute the original
one-qubit X plus separately labelled small synthetic cases. Larger original
files are not simulated by this test grid. See the
[delivery and compatibility counts](../../../docs/roadmap/CS07_QMOD_PARSER_DELIVERY.md).

## Initially admitted grammar

One `qfunc main` has only output scalar parameters. Scalars are qbit, bare qnum
or `qnum<positive literal width>`. All are unsigned integral storage in this
profile. Statements are fresh assignment, allocate(var), allocate(literal,var),
X/H/S/Z on qbit, and hadamard_transform on one scalar. Right-hand expressions
use declared outputs, nonnegative decimal literals, parentheses, +, * and a
literal **2. Standard arithmetic precedence applies. Line and block comments
and CRLF are accepted. The entire source must be consumed.

Omitted qnum widths resolve at initialization. Literal allocation sizes must
agree with explicit declarations. Fresh assignment uses the complete unsigned
expression domain; a wider declared target is preserved with zero extension.
Quantum variables are not folded from the basis values used to initialize them.
Pure literal subexpressions can be folded. Duplicate output names, unknown
symbols, uninitialized reads and repeated initialization are rejected, with
native source locations. Single-qubit calls on qnum, numeric indexing, arrays,
slices, bind, locals, helper definitions, classical parameters, Input/Const,
free/drop, control/invert/within, signed/fractional numbers, in-place assignment
and other functions/operators are outside this subset and must fail explicitly.

Limits: 262,144 UTF-8 source bytes, 4,096 tokens, depth 32, 78 decimal digits per
literal, 256-bit scalar domains and at most 4,096 expanded effect operations.
The existing Compiler independently enforces total model/node/live-width budgets. No truncation or silent best-effort conversion is allowed.

`parse_qmod(..., source_version=...)` requires explicit context matching retained
Classiq commit `2bfd835e73b6882fcc515a725098b04766c238e7`. That argument is a
caller declaration, not proof of source authorship or a hash check. The original
fixture manifest separately proves byte integrity. Current documentation may
change; do not silently accept another source version or expand the grammar.
