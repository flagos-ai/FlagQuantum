# Quantum error correction

Build experiments that connect syndrome extraction, decoding, correction, and
logical-result analysis. The long-term direction is a complete QEC workflow
for fault-tolerant quantum computing research, including logical operations
and hardware feedback.

QEC owns codes, decoder semantics, detection events, and Pauli frames. It
composes Compiler control flow, Runtime feedback, Simulation kernels, Noise
models, and Remote hardware interfaces.

## Start with a memory experiment

This experimental local example uses the three-data-qubit repetition-code
profile and injects one X error before syndrome extraction:

```python
from flagquantum.qec import ErrorEvent, ErrorSchedule, run_repetition_memory_experiment

result = run_repetition_memory_experiment(
    error_schedule=ErrorSchedule((ErrorEvent(round_index=0, wire=1),)),
    rounds=3,
    shots=16,
    seed=0,
)
print(result.logical_error_rate)
```

## Declare a code and its detection layout

`codes.py` holds the code records and `circuit.py` turns one into a memory
experiment. This is the code-independent layer beside the frozen repetition
profile:

```python
from flagquantum.qec import RotatedSurfaceCode, build_memory_circuit

memory = build_memory_circuit(RotatedSurfaceCode(distance=3), rounds=3)
print(len(memory.detectors), len(memory.observables))
```

A detector is a measurement parity that is deterministic in the noiseless
circuit. Because both the initial state and the terminal data readout are in the
Z basis, a Z-type check declares a detector in every round plus one terminal
detector, while an X-type check declares one for every round after the first. A
code whose declared logical observable is not Z-type is refused rather than
measured under premises that do not hold for it.

## Decode a detection-event syndrome

`decoding_graph.py` turns a detector error model into a weighted graph and
`matching.py` decodes a syndrome on it. This is the code-independent decoder: it
reads the model's mechanisms and nothing about the code that produced them.

```python
from flagquantum.qec import (
    DetectorErrorModel,
    MinimumWeightMatchingDecoder,
    PhenomenologicalNoise,
    RepetitionCode,
    build_memory_circuit,
)

model = DetectorErrorModel.from_memory_circuit(
    build_memory_circuit(RepetitionCode(distance=3), rounds=3),
    noise=PhenomenologicalNoise(data_flip=0.02, measurement_flip=0.02),
)
decoder = MinimumWeightMatchingDecoder.from_detector_error_model(model)
sample = model.dem_sampling(shots=1, seed=0)
syndrome = tuple(int(i) for i in sample.detectors[0].nonzero().flatten())
print(decoder.decode(syndrome).observables)
```

An edge weight is `log((1 - p) / p)`, a mechanism that flips one detector becomes
an edge to a boundary node, and the decoder's prediction is the exclusive-or of
the selected mechanisms' observable labels. A mechanism that flips three or more
detectors is a hyperedge and is refused with a stated reason rather than
projected onto a pair. The matcher enumerates the ways to pair the defective
detectors, so it refuses a syndrome larger than its defect budget instead of
returning a pairing that only looks cheapest.

## Change and verify

Use [repetition.py](repetition.py) for experiment composition,
[decoders.py](decoders.py) for decoding, [decoding_graph.py](decoding_graph.py)
and [matching.py](matching.py) for the detector-error-model decoder,
[noise.py](noise.py) for code-specific noise profiles, [codes.py](codes.py) for
code records, [circuit.py](circuit.py) for detector and observable layouts, and
[types.py](types.py) for records. Run from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/qec -q
python tools/check_architecture.py
```

Check syndrome histories, correction actions, and final logical outcomes for
known injected errors. Decoder changes must also cover readout faults and
errors near the final round. Logical suppression or threshold claims require
separate statistical and scaling evidence.

[Feedback modes and model boundaries](IMPLEMENTATION.md) explain the supported
profiles. This reference experiment does not establish general FTQC or
hard-real-time hardware feedback.
